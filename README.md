Code-Jam
========

This project is intended for people who love code and solve [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam/ "Code Jam") problems (or any other programming contests), but are bored of constantly setting the environment for each problem set. I'm strive to make this project independent of the particular programming language or operating system, but please keep in mind that this is an early alpha version already tested only on my Windows box.

Here are some goals I try to achieve:
 * automating code environment setup for your language of choice (directory structure, IDE files, etc),
 * fast testing code against sample input-output set and self prepared test sets,
 * fast output generation when you attempt to solve problem,
 * more friendly solution sending (currently I have no idea, what it could be, [Google's Commandline tool](https://code.google.com/p/codejam-commandline/ "Code Jam Commandline tool") maybe?)
 
 Please let me know if you would like to participate in any way (e.g. improving english of this text ;)
